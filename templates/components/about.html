            Hello there! I'm Josh. It's nice to meet you! ðŸ‘‹

            I'm a developer with a strong focus on web developmentâ€”building responsive, modern websites and
            applications is my bread and butter. But I donâ€™t stop there. I dabble in AI, exploring how to integrate
            it into projects and push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible. Iâ€™ve also got a thing for programming
            language design, experimenting with how languages work under the hood and tweaking them to solve
            specific problems.

            On the creative side, I enjoy game developmentâ€”designing gameplay, mechanics, and systems that feel
            engaging. I like diving into low-level programming, too, working closer to the hardware to write
            efficient, optimized code. Overall, Iâ€™m all about exploring different areas of software development,
            solving problems, and constantly improving.
